MYCRYPTO APP
Developing comments

- In Mycryptoapp i tried to start from in the beginning with good practices regarding the architecture of the project

- The best way to implement the rankings is to the end point info, in futures releases this feature will be implemented, i thing because only info path get the image for the coin

- decide use kotlin because now it has good documentation compared with pass times

- decide no a empty activity because the project can grow with the time
